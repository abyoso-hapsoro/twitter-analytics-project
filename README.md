Real-Time Indonesian Tweets Sentiment Analytics Dashboard with Social Network Analysis, Word Cloud and Sentiment Analysis features. Used to be deployed and hosted on [Heroku](https://twitter-analytics-project.herokuapp.com) which is no longer maintained due to [removal of free tier](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/2461). Local implementation likely no longer works due to package deprecations.
